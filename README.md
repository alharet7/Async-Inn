## Description: üìù

The Async Inn Hotel Asset Management System is a web-based API designed to help Async Inn, a local hotel chain, better manage its hotel assets across multiple locations. This project aims to provide a RESTful API server that allows the management of rooms, amenities, and new hotel locations. The system leverages a relational database to store and maintain the integrity of the data.

## Hotel tables:

- **Hotel table** has a location ID which is a primary key which means it is only up for a hotel because we don't have two hotels with the same location ID. and it also had a name, city, and state. and each hotel has many rooms and is connected with rooms table.

- **Room table**: The room table has a room ID which is a primary key, nickname, and layout Enum. and the room has a relationship with two tables it is one to many Rooms because this room is one room in many rooms in the hotel and many to many with amenities because many rooms can have many amenities and many amenities, can be assigned for many rooms.

- **Amenities table**: The amenity table has a primary key ID and name attribute and the Amenity table has a relation with room and it is many to many.

- **Hotel Rooms table**: A hotel room is a Joint entity table between two tables it has payload attributes like a price, a pet-friendly and it is many-to-one with the hotel and many-to-one with Room so in each Hotel we have a unique number of room number and it is composite key between the room ID and hotel location ID

- **Room-Amenities table**: this is a pure join table with a Composite-Foreign key the amenity ID and the room ID, so let's explain the data flow here, each room can have multi amenities but can't take duplicated amenities you can't find a room with two coffee maker for example, and many amenities can belong to a single room.
